<h1>How does the temperature of water effect the rate at which color dissolves from an M&M? </h1>

<h2> Data Collection </h2>

<p>First we filled up three cups, one with a medium temperature, around 30 C, a cold one, around 20, and a final with hot water, around 45. Then we would drop an M&M into one of the cups and start stirring while timing. Once the M&M was devoid of all color we would stop the timer and record the data of the temperature of the water and how long it took to dissolve the color. We repeated that until we had done 65 M&M's.</p>

<h2>Data Analysis </h2>

<p>After reviewing the data we collected and comparing the time it took for the color to dissolve in relation to the heat of the water we found that in general the hotter the water the faster the color was dissolved.</p>
