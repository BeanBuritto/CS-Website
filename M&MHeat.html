<h1>How does the temperature of water effect the rate at which color dissolves from an M&M? </h1>

<h2> Data Collection </h2>

<p>First we filled up three cups, one with a medium temperature, around 30 C, a cold one, around 20, and a final with hot water, around 45. Then we would drop an M&M into one of the cups and start stirring while timing. Once the M&M was devoid of all color we would stop the timer and record the data of the temperature of the water and how long it took to dissolve the color. </p>
