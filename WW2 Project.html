<h1>How did the military manpower of countries during WWII affect their tank and airplane production </h1>

<h2> Data Collection </h2>

  <p>Using a couple of TuvaLabs collections we colleceted data of twelve different countries. </p>

<h2>Data Analysis </h2>

<p>We put the data of countries manpower, tank and airplane production into a spreadsheat and organized a couple of graphs to help understand the data. We found that in general the higher the manpower the more tank and airplane production. For example the top three tank producers are also the top three countries on manpower. At the same time results could be varied. For example Japan had the fourth most manpower but one of the lowest tank productions.
